        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I currently live in Vancouver, WA and am attending <strong>Epicodus</strong>. Before moving to Vancouver last August, I lived in NW Portland, Oregon and worked primarily as a Makeup Artist for weddings. I have a one-year-old daughter named Cloa with my partner, James, and she is the sweetest, brightest, and funniest tiny human I know.</p>
        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Communications from <span class ="special">Santa Clara University</span>. In 2007, I started working at <span class ="special">Google</span> on their <span class ="special">Online Sales</span> team. While at Google, I worked on various sales and marketing teams and specialized in <span class ="special">Display and YouTube</span> ads. In 2013, I left Google to travel and pursue a new career in the beauty industry. That same year, I moved to Portland and started attending the <span class="special">Aveda Institute of Portland</span>. In 2014, I got my Esthetics certification, and since then I've worked in various Portland salons and on dozens of photoshoots, runway shows, and weddings.</p>
