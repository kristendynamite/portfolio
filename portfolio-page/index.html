    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Photo of Kristen" />
    <p>I currently live in Vancouver, WA and am attending Epicodus. Before moving to Vancouver last August, I lived in NW Portland, Oregon and worked primarily as a Makeup Artist for weddings. I have a one-year-old daughter named Cloa with my partner, James, and she is the sweetest, brightest, and funniest tiny human I know.</p>


    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Communications from Santa Clara University. I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2007. That same year, I started working at Google in their Online Sales team. While at Google, I worked on various sales teams and specialized in YouTube and AdWords advertising. In 2013, I left Google to travel and pursue a new career in the beauty industry. That same year, I moved to Portland and started attending the Aveda Institute. In 2014, I got my Esthetics certification, and since then I've worked in various Portland salons and on dozens of photoshoots, runway shows, and weddings.</p>
